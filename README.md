An RNN-based time series model for predicting weight and calorie intake over the next 7 days using historical data. The model is trained on past weight and calorie intake values, leveraging LSTM layers and data preprocessing techniques to provide predictions for future values. This project demonstrates how to apply deep learning to health and fitness data for personalized predictions.
